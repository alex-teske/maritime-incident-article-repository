The Indonesian tanker, M/T "Tri Samudra" was transporting methane gas when it was attacked along the coast line of Borneo Island. Eventually, the ship was released, but the Captain and Chief Engineer were kidnapped and are currently being held for ransom.



The pirates are believed to be from the Free Aceh Movement, which is fighting for independence of the Areh province, north of Sumatra Island. Malaysia has now announced that it will be boosting security in the straits because of the attack.
