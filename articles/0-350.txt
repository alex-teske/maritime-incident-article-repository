Port and terminal operator APM Terminals Poti has signed an agreement with Poti New Terminals Consortium for a new bulk cargo terminal.

On January 12, the parties inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a USD 100 million dollar investment in the terminal that can process 1.5 million tons of dry bulk cargo annually and generate new trade opportunities for customers in the Georgian transit corridor.

The new terminal is expected to be built on APM Terminals Poti land and infrastructure and will entail the construction, development and operation of a new breakwater, dry bulk cargo terminal and related infrastructure to serve bulk cargo customers.

Poti New Terminals’ expertise will design, develop and manage the dry bulk cargo terminal to today’s world-class port standards.
