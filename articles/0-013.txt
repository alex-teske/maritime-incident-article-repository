Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University (RGU) has launched a the world's first decommissioning simulator to service the growing sector in the U.K. and elsewhere.

The simulator focuses on well plugging and abandonment and was developed in collaboration with funding partners The Oil and Gas Technology Centre, KCA Deutag and Drilling Systems, with technical support from Baker Hughes.

Well plugging and abandonment is forecast to cost the U.K. more than £8 billion ($10.8 billion) over the next decade, with around 2,500 wells expected to be decommissioned across the U.K., Danish, Dutch and Norwegian Continental Shelves.

The simulator can support both oil and gas operators and service companies and has the potential to significantly enhance safety, improve efficiency and reduce the cost associated with decommissioning oil and gas wells.

Professor Paul de Leeuw, Director of RGU’s Oil and Gas Institute, said: “Operators and drilling contractors will be able to use the simulator to develop the technical and non-technical skills and capabilities of their rig crews for decommissioning wells, while improving team performance.”
