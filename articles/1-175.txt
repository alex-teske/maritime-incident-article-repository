Six robbers armed with guns boarded and fired upon the duty crew on board a container ship at Conakry anchorage, Guinea, on Wednesday, September 21, according to IMB.

The vessel’s Master activated the SSAS alert, raised the alarm and locked the accommodation.

The robbers, however, gained access into the ship by breaking the bridge wing windows.

After taking the crew hostage, the robbers ransacked and looted every crew cabin, stole crew personal belongings, ship’s cash and escaped.

The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre liaised with the Guinea Navy who responded and boarded the ship. All crew are reported safe.

IMB did not reveal the name of the raided vessel. However, according to available information and AIS data, the vessel in question could be the 2009-built Windhoek.

AIS data currently shows Windhoek leaving Conakry en route to Monrovia, Liberia
