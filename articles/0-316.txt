Distributions will be payable on the Series E preferred units from and including the original issue date to, but excluding February 15, 2025 at a fixed rate equal to 8.875% per annum of the stated liquidation preference of USD 25.00 per unit; and from and including February 15, 2025, at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 640.7 basis points.

The Partnership expects to use the net proceeds from the public offering for general partnership purposes, which may include funding installment payments on newbuildings and conversion projects and debt repayments.

Teekay Offshore intends to apply to have the Series E Preferred Units listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
