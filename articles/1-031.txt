According to the International Maritime Bureau's Live Piracy Report, ten robbers armed with guns and knives boarded and hijacked a product tanker underway.

They tied up all the crewmembers and held them hostage in one cabin.

Later, they commanded that Master to steer the ship to a pre-designated position. The vessel came alongside another orange hull tanker and the robbers forced the C/O and the bosun to use the cargo pumps and valves and the mooring winches.

At around 1600LT the robbers left the ship after transferring and stealing all the gas oil. Before leaving the ship, the assailants also stole the crew's belongings. No crewmen were injured during this incident.

The hijacking took place around 7.3nm West of Pulau Kukup, Malaysia on Thursday, November 7.
