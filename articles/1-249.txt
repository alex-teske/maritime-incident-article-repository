A 156,000 dwt, 2011 built tanker has been hijacked by Somali pirates. GAC Protective Services says that a maritime security alert has been issued for the Arabian Sea after Liberia-flagged product tanker Smyrni was confirmed as pirated on May 10.

The vessel was reportedly attacked around 285NM south east of Masirah Island, Oman, at around 0930 local time and later confirmed as hijacked by UKMTO. The tanker is managed by Athens-based Dynacom Tanker Management and has a top speed of 9 knots and a freeboard of 7.7 m.

The hijacking comes after weeks of increased mothership activity in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian sea; vessels in the area are advised to proceed with caution and be wary of suspect dhows hidden amongst local traffic.
