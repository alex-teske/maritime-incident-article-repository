MV Werften Cuts Steel for Polar Class Expedition Yacht

by worldmaritimenews

German shipbuilder MV Werften has launched the construction of a new luxury expedition yacht for cruise line Crystal Yacht Expedition Cruises.

The first piece of steel for the yacht, named Crystal Endeavor, was cut at MV Werften’s Stralsund site on January 15.

Set to debut in 2020, Crystal Endeavor will be the largest and most spacious purpose-built Polar Class ship, according to MV Werften.

To feature a PC6 Polar Class designation, the megayacht will be able to cruise in Polar Regions during the summer and autumn in medium “first year” ice which may include old ice inclusions.

It will also be fitted with offshore dynamic positioning technology, with computer-controlled systems to automatically maintain the ship’s position with its own propellers and thrusters.

“The Crystal Endeavor is a truly exceptional ship. We are proud to be able to implement this project and are particularly pleased to, once again, be starting shipbuilding activities in the Stralsund shipyard, creating hundreds of new jobs,” Jarmo Laakso, CEO of MV Werften, said.

“We look forward to this innovative expedition yacht with great anticipation in the Stralsund shipyard,” Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, Genting Hong Kong Chairman and CEO, said.
