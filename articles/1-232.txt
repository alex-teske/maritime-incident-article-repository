Somalia: North Korea Ship Foils Pirates

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SEPT. 15, 2009

Somali pirates tried but failed to hijack a North Korean cargo ship almost two weeks ago when crew members fought back with Molotov cocktails, a maritime official said Tuesday. The ship was drifting off the Somali coast near Mogadishu on Sept. 5 as the crew worked on the engine when 10 pirates approached in two speedboats, said Noel Choong, who heads the International Maritime Bureauâ€™s piracy reporting center in Malaysia. The North Korean ship immediately started its engine and moved away, and the captain called the bureau for help when the pirates, dressed in military clothing, began firing rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, Mr. Choong said.
