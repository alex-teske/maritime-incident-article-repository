Somali Pirates Seize Cargo Ship

By THE NEW YORK TIMES NOV. 11, 2009

MOGADISHU, Somalia — Somali pirates said Wednesday that they had seized a container ship with 22 crew members on board after a five-hour chase across the Indian Ocean, reflecting both an increase in pirate activity after the end of monsoon storms and signs of increasing boldness among the hijackers.

The African Seafarers’ Assistance Program, based in Kenya, identified the vessel as the Filitsa, Reuters reported. Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for the program, told Reuters that it was sailing under a Marshall Islands flag and carrying chemicals to South Africa from Kuwait.

A pirate who gave his name only as Abdi said in a telephone interview that the hijacking on Tuesday followed a clash the day before when international naval forces patrolling the Indian Ocean opened fire on three speedboats carrying pirates, hitting four men. It was not clear if they were wounded or had been killed, Abdi said.

Other pirates escaped and commandeered the Filitsa while out searching for their compatriots, Abdi said.

The European Union said in a statement Wednesday that the crew of the vessel was made up of 3 Greek and 19 Filipino citizens. The ship was seized 400 miles northeast of Seychelles.
