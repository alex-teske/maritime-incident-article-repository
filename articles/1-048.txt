On 21 Aug and 22 Aug 2015, six vessels while underway in the eastbound lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore reported to the Singapore Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS) via VHF about five unauthorized boardings and an attempted one. See map below on the approximate location of the incidents. The Singapore Port Operation Control Center (POCC) immediately notified the authorities of the littoral States and initiated navigational broadcast to warn mariners to maintain anti-piracy watch.
