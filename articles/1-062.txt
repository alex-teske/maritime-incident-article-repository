On 28 Aug 14 at or about 2040 hrs, six pirates armed with guns boarded a Thailand registered oil product tanker, V.L. 14 at approximately 30 nm north of Pulau Tioman (03° 24’ N, 104° 04.80’ E). The vessel of 1074 GT was enroute from Singapore to Bangkok, carrying 1,296 tonnes of lube oil. The pirates came alongside in a wooden speed boat, approached the vessel on the portside, and boarded from stern. They broke the bridge glass, gained access to the crew cabins and gathered the crew in the engine room.

The pirates took control of the vessel, sailed about 10 nm away from the location of
boarding. They ordered the crew to open all cargo valves, activate the cargo pump and
transfer the lube oil to two tankers which came alongside. The pirates also stole the
crew’s personal belongings, damaged the navigational and communication system before
they left V.L. 14 at or about 0400 hrs on 29 Aug 14. The crew repaired the windlass back
to service temporarily, heaved up the anchor, sailed towards Pulau Tioman and reported
the incident to the company. The crew was not injured.

Upon receiving report about the incident from the ship owner on 29 Aug 14, the
ReCAAP ISC alerted the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) and triggered
the ReCAAP Focal Point (Thailand) to follow up with the investigation of the incident.
