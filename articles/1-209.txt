Pirates Seize Tanker Off African Coast

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Pirates hijacked a huge tanker off the Horn of Africa on Friday, even as world powers deployed military ships to the Somali coast on Saturday to try to end a two-week standoff aboard another seized ship laden with tanks and weapons, officials said.

The latest ship to be seized, a Greek vessel flying a Panamanian flag, was traveling from Southeast Asia to Europe, said Noel Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureau’s piracy reporting center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. There were no further details on the ship.

Meanwhile, on Somalia’s coast, pirates who have been holding the arms-laden Ukrainian freighter threatened to destroy it unless a ransom is paid. Six United States Navy warships are surrounding the ship, called the Faina, and a Russian frigate was heading toward the scene.

Pirates have seized more than two dozen ships this year off the Horn of Africa, but the hijacking of the Faina has drawn the most international concern because of its dangerous cargo — 33 tanks and other heavy weapons.
