Frustrated Pirates Set Ship Ablaze After Failed Hijacking

September 21, 2011 by Mike Schuler

Pirates set a cargo ship ablaze yesterday after an unsuccessful hijacking attempt.

The International Maritime Bureau reports that pirates aboard two skiffs armed with guns and RPG’s boarded the general cargo ship M/V Pacific Express while underway approximately 300nm east of Mombasa, Kenya.  The crewmembers were able to retreat to the vessels citadel and requested for assistance.

The pirates, unable to take control of the vessel, set the ship ablaze in attempt to force the crew out of the citadel.

NATO’s counter piracy flagship, the ITS Andrea Doria, responded, sending a boarding team to evacuate the crew of 26 unharmed.

The M/V Pacific Express is owned by Athens-baded Estelle Shipping Company Ltd and managed by Cyprus Maritime Company Ltd, also of Athens, Greece.
