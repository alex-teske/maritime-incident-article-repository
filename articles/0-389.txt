JAKARTA, Indonesia — A balcony collapsed inside the Indonesia Stock Exchange building complex in Jakarta on Monday, injuring more than 70 people, according to the police.

A large number of Indonesian university students were said to be on the balcony when it suddenly collapsed beneath them just minutes after noon, officials said.

Many of the injured appeared to have suffered fractures, according to police and hospital officials.

People could be seen lying on the ground after the collapse, which occurred near a Starbucks coffee shop. The building complex is in a business district near the city center, and international businesses and agencies, including the World Bank, have offices in the building where the stock exchange is.

Officials ordered the immediate evacuation of the complex as rescue workers descended on the accident site and began looking into the cause of the collapse.

Maj. Gen. Setyo Wasisto, a police spokesman, ruled out the possibility of terrorism. “I am sure that this was not caused by a bomb,” he said.

General Wasisto said late Monday night that of the 73 people hospitalized for injuries, 11 had been released.

Farida Riady, a spokeswoman for the Indonesia Stock Exchange building’s management, apologized for the accident.

“Suddenly the mezzanine floor collapsed,” she said at a news conference on Monday. “We have not been able to provide any detailed information right now about why this happened.”
