According to a Spanish government statement, at 5.40 AM Spanish time, November 29, 2009, Spain's Center for Maritime Surveillance Operations was notified that the fishing OrtubŽ Berria Spanish flag was being attacked by suspected pirates.

The attack was confirmed by telephone by the master of OrtubŽ Berria, who reported the following facts: On the 29th, about 5.37 Spanish time, two skiffs attacked the vessel 230 nautical miles southwest of the Seychelles. The pirates opened fire with light weapons and RPG grenade. After 30 minutes of chase, the attack was repelled by the private security team on board, who made use of their weapons.

Operation Atalanta (TF 465) has sent the Portuguese frigate Alvares Cabral to the area together with maritime patrol aircraft based in the Seychelles Islands.
