JBIC to Finance Ta-Tong Marine’s New Ore Carrier

by worldmaritimenews

Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) has reached an agreement to provide a loan to Taiwanese shipowner Ta Tong Marine for the purchase of a newbuilding ore carrier.

Featuring 241,000 dwt, the ore carrier would be registered to a Panama-based company, MacLin Sunny Maritime SA.

The vessel in question would be constructed by Japan’s shipbuilder Imabari Shipbuilding.

Reportedly ordered in 2017, the bulk carrier is expected to join the fleet in 2019. It is understood that the ship would start working under a long-term charter contract with Japan’s shipping major Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) following delivery.

According to data provided by VesselsValue, Ta Tong Marine owns a fleet of eight Japanese-built vessels, including seven bulk carriers and one tanker.

“This loan supports the export of vessels built by Japanese shipyards, which plays a major role in the regional economy,” JBIC said.
