The latest ship to fall victim to Somali pirates is the 13,065 dwt Marshall Islands flag products tanker MT Motivator, managed by Athens-based Eveland Shipping.

EU Navfor says that in the early hours of July 4 the ship reported it was under small arms fire in the northern Bab Al Mandeb area in the southern Red Sea. Eu Navfor says attempts were made to make contact with the Motivator but to no avail. The hijack was confirmed early on July 5.

EU Navfor says the ship has a crew of 18 Filipino nationals on board and is carrying a cargo of lubricants.
