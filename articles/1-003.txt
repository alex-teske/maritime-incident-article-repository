The ship had trouble docking initially as a sand storm had reduced visibility, a government statement said. The ship's captain is reported to have radioed the port manager to report difficulty in manoeuvering. Shortly afterwards, contact was lost with the vessel. The ship consignee, Koda Maritime, informed the port officials that armed men had taken control of the tanker.

The statement said officials located the vessel off neighboring Ghana, and that authorities were mobilized.
