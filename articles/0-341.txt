Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) has acquired full ownership of Azalea Maritime B.V., a Dutch manning specialist.

The acquisition of 100 percent ownership was completed on December 21, 2017, and Azalea Maritime B.V. changed its name to MOL Maritime (Europe) B.V. on January 1, 2018, MOL said.

The company specializes in providing crews for tankers and carriers of liquified natural gas.

With the move, MOL plans to bolster manning of its operated LNG carriers and tankers, the safety of operation being a top priority.

“MOL Maritime (Europe) B.V. as a manning company, will continue to support MOL safe operation, while inheriting Azalea Maritime’s accumulated experience with European seafarers and know-how of the manning business,” MOL added.

Azalea Maritime Agency was established in January 1997 with its headquarters in Herceg Novi – Montenegro.

The Japanese conglomerate has 21 LNG carriers, 2 LPG carriers and 64 tankers in its operated fleet registered under different subsidiaries and joint ventures.

The company has 14 LNG carriers under construction at Japanese, Chinese and South Korean yards, eight of them scheduled for delivery in 2018, data from VesselsValue shows.
