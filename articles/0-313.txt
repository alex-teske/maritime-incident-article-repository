GoodBulk Adds Another CarVal Capesize

by worldmaritimenews

Ship owner and operator GoodBulk has taken delivery of Aquabridge, a 2005-built Capesize bulk carrier. 

The 177,106 dwt ship is the second of six option Capesize vessels acquired by GoodBulk from funds managed by CarVal Investors on December 20.

The vessel was financed with a combination of cash on hand, availability under existing credit facilities and the issuance of 180,542 new common shares to funds managed by CarVal. Following the share issue to CarVal, the company will have 17,644,083 outstanding common shares, GoodBulk said.

Built by Namura shipyard in Japan, Aquabridge is currently employed on an index-linked charter until the third quarter of 2018.

Including the Panama-flagged Aquabridge, GoodBulk currently has a fleet of thirteen Capesize, one Panamax, and two Supramax vessels on the water operating in the spot market, with an additional nine Capesize vessels expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2018.
