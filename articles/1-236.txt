Eu Navfor says that the 52,466 dwt bulk carrier MV Sinin is believed to have been hijacked approximately 350 nautical miles East of Masirah (Oman) in the North Arabian Sea.  According to Iran Watch, the vessel is owned by ISIM Sinin Ltd. and the ship manager is Irano-Hind Shipping Co. Iran Watch identifies Irano-Hind Shipping as a subsidiary of Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL).

The vessel, which has a crew of 23 (13 Iranian and 10 Indian nationals), sent out a distress signal, saying she was under attack, late afternoon on Saturday to which an aircraft from the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) immediately responded.  The aircraft photographed two suspected pirate skiffs on board the vessel. There has been no communication with the ship since the distress signal was sent and the MV Sinin has now changed course towards the Somali coast.  There is no information on the condition of the crew.  

The  ship was on route to Singapore from Fujairah (UAE) when she was attacked. The ship was not registered with MSC(HOA) and was not reporting to UKMTO. EUNAVFOR is monitoring the situation.
