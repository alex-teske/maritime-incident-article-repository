By maritimeworldnews November 29, 2016

A merchant vessel is believed to have been hijacked by pirates some 72 nautical miles off the coast of Cotonou, Benin, according to data provided by Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG).

The event, described as “suspicious,” occurred in the night of November 27 while the vessel was travelling south.

The ship changed direction to head back into port and has been drifting since the evening hours of November 28.

“We have strong reason to believe that it is under piracy attack and pirates have taken control of the vessel,” MDAT-GoG said, adding that agent and port control have been notified, however, there were no further information about the incident available.

MDAT-GoG noted that the owner of the vessel received the SSAS and tried to establish a contact, but without results.

The vessel’s AIS, as well as other means of communication, have been switched off.
