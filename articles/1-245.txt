Pirates hijack North Korean ship

February 4, 2010

The latest reported victim of Somali pirates is a North Korean general cargo ship.

EU NAVFOR says the 4,800 ton M/V RIM was reported to have been hijacked this morning in the Gulf of Aden to the north of the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). The RIM was in the northwest area of the Gulf of Aden just south of the Yemeni coast. The North Korean flagged ship owned by White Sea Shipping of Libya.

A coalition ship USS PORTER and a helicopter from USS FARRAGUT, both of CMF CTF 151, confirmed that the RIM had been hijacked.

The RIM has now altered course and is heading towards the Somali Basin. Coalition forces will monitor the situation.

RIM is not registered with MSC HOA and has had no communications with UKMTO.
