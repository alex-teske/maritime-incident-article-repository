KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Pirates hijacked a Philippine chemical tanker with 23 crew members near Somalia, bringing the total number of attacks in waters off the impoverished African nation this year to 83, a maritime official said Tuesday.

At least two other hijacking attempts in the region were thwarted in the last few days, officials said.

The Philippine tanker was heading to Asia when it was seized Monday in the Gulf of Aden by pirates armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, said Noel Choong, head of the International Maritime Bureau’s piracy reporting center.
