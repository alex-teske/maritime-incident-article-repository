BY NYTIMES August 9, 1989

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Aug. 8â€” A group of pirates who stormed a boat carrying 84 Vietnamese stole valuables, raped women and sunk the vessel, and 71 of the refugees were feared dead.

The attack brought to 271 the number of boat people missing and believed dead as a result of piracy off the coast of this Southeast Asian nation this year, United Nations and Malaysian officials reported.

The officials, quoting the 13 survivors of the latest attack, said the refugees left Vietnam last week. They were off the Kuala Trengganu coast, 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, when they were attacked Saturday night by pirates in two boats. In the past, refugee officials have blamed Thai pirates for most of such attacks.

Three survivors were rescued on Sunday by oil-rig workers in the South China Sea, and fishermen picked up the 10 others.
