Shell Orders FPSO for Penguins Field

by worldmaritimenews

Oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell has decided to order a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for its Penguins field.

The move comes as the company revealed plans to redevelop the abovementioned oil and gas field in the UK North Sea.

US-based engineering and construction company Fluor has been awarded the FPSO engineering, procurement and construction contract, Shell said.

Additionally, Norway-based firm Sevan Marine ASA will provide the technology for the circular FPSO as well as technical support during the design phase of the project.

“Sevan Marine will also continue to provide engineering support during the construction of the unit over the next 3 to 4 years,” Sevan Marine said in a statement.

As informed, the FPSO is expected to have a peak production (100%) of circa 45,000 boe/d.

A joint venture-owned/Shell-operated Sevan 400 FPSO has been selected as the development option for the field. Oil will be transported via tanker to refineries and gas will be transported via the FLAGS pipeline to the St Fergus gas terminal in north-east Scotland.
