WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Pirates using rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked a United States-flagged cargo ship on Tuesday off the coast of Somalia, but they failed to board the craft, the ship’s owner said.

The crew of the ship, the Liberty Sun, was unharmed, but the vessel suffered damage, according to a statement from the owner, Liberty Maritime Corporation, of Lake Success, N.Y.

A United States military official said the Liberty Sun was attacked about 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The Bainbridge, a destroyer, was sent to provide assistance, the official said.

The pirates were gone when the Bainbridge arrived three hours later, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Liberty Maritime said the ship was carrying American food aid for African nations and was headed to Mombasa, Kenya, from Houston.

The Bainbridge was the same Navy vessel that responded last week after another United States-flagged cargo ship was attacked off Somalia’s coast. On Sunday, Navy Seal commandos brought that episode to an end by killing three pirates and rescuing the American ship captain they had held hostage for five days.
