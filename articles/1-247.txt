Somali pirates have seized another ship. In the early hours of this morning, reports Eu Navfor, the 104,255 dwt oil tanker MV Savina Caylyn was hijacked approximately 670 nautical miles east of Socotra Island in the Indian Ocean. The vessel was boarded after a sustained attack by one skiff with five suspected pirates firing small arms and four rocket propelled grenades.

NATO says a pirate mother ship was sighted in the area

The Italian-flagged Savina Caylyn is owned by Dolphin Tankers, a Genoa headquartered joint venture between shipowner Fratelli D'Amato and the Scerni Group.

The vessel was on passage to Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) from Bashayer (Sudan) when it was attacked. There is presently no communication with the vessel and no information regarding the condition of the crew of 22 (5 Italian and 17 Indian). The ship had registered with MSC(HOA) and was reporting to the UKMTO. Eu Navfor is monitoring the situation.
