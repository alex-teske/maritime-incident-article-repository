By worldmaritimenews July 8, 2016

A group of armed pirates has approached and opened fire upon a tanker which was underway some 89 nautical miles off the coast of Brass, Nigeria, according to data provided by the International Maritime Bureauâ€™s Piracy Reporting Centre (IMB PRC).

The vessel in question was reportedly the 2006-built Suezmax tanker Bouboulina.

IMB PRC said that, as the boat came alongside the vessel on July 7, the alarm was raised and all crew retreated into the citadel from where they controlled the vessel.

After some four hours the crew emerged from the citadel and found that the bridge windows were shattered due to the firing.

There were no injuries reported following the incident.

The 163,800 dwt vessel continued its voyage to the port of destination, IMB PRC added.

The Greece-flagged tanker is owned by the Greek shipping company Delta Tankers, according to VesselsValue.
