Armed pirates attempted to board a RORO vessel confirmed as MV Silver Sky owned by Dubai-based Sallaum Lines while the ship was on its way in the Gulf of Guinea, some 64 nautical miles of Beyelsa.

According to a report from the International Maritime Bureau, the vessel was fired upon yesterday, January 19th by pirates who were chasing the vessel in an attempt to board. It has been disclosed that one crew member has been shot in the hijacking attempt. After being unsuccessful in boarding the vessel, the pirates aborted their chase.

The attack has been confirmed to World Maritime News by the ship owner.

Based on the latest update, the Panama-flagged RORO ship is now on its way to the final destination, Cotonou, Benin where it is expected to arrive today.

All authorities within the area have been notified and vessels in the vicinity of the attack are advised to increase their anti-piracy deterrents.

Sallaum Enterprises provides liner service from Europe, USA and most recently West Africa where it operates under the name of Sallaum Lines DMCC.

Sallaum Lines owned and chartered fleet consists of modern Pure Car & Truck Carrier (PCTC) vessels with an average capacity exceeding 4.000 RT. The company has eight ships in its fleet, as disclosed on its website.
