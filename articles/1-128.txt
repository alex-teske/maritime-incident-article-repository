March 9, 2014 by Rob Almeida

As Dryad Maritime Intelligence warned of an increased danger of attacks and kidnappings in the Gulf of Guinea on Friday, another supply boat had just been attacked off the Niger Delta marking the tenth such incident in recent weeks just outside national territorial waters.

Media reports sourced by Dryad indicate the 67-meter Nigerian-flagged supply vessel Prime Lady, owned by Aberdeen-based Prime Gulf International, was attacked on 6 March approximately 15 nautical miles offshore while she was in transit from Onne to the Utpotiki field.  The Captain and one other crew member were reportedly kidnapped.

Location of attack: 04 11.6N 005 44.0E

Dryad’s analysts note in an emailed report that “half of the attacks have resulted in the kidnapping of senior crew members for ransom; the other attacks are almost certainly failed attempts to abduct crew.”

This latest attack further highlights the absolute necessity for vessel crews operating in the region to maintain highest possible state of vigilance and readiness, particularly with regard to “maintaining an alert lookout for the movements of local traffic.” says Dryad.

Furthermore, Dryad recommends that any vessel operating within 200 nautical miles of the Gulf of Guinea coastline should implement “full security measures” and maintain contact with local official security forces and port authorities. “Crews should be especially wary when operating away from localized security provided by the Nigerian Navy or the oil companies’ private security” and all incidents should be immediately reported to the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre via quickest means available.
