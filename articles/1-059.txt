On the same day at or about 1042 hrs (local time), a Malaysia-registered tug
boat, Kien San 1 towing barge Kien San 8 loaded with scrap metal was underway
northwest of Nipa Anchorage in the westbound lane when four men boarded the
barge from the stern. The master and crew tried to scare away the perpetuators.
The Singapore Police Coast Guard deployed a patrol craft to the location of the
incident but the men escaped in their small boats. No items were stolen from the
barge and the crew was not injured.
