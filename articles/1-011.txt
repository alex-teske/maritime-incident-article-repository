A chemical/oil products tanker was hijacked by suspected pirates off the coast of Gabon, a West African nation. The ship had 24 Indian crewmembers onboard during the time of the attack.

The Malta-flagged MV Cotton was reportedly taken over about 15 miles off Port Gentil on July 15th.

The tanker was awaiting berthing in the Gulf of Guinea at the time of the hijack.

Much of the other details are still unclear including the cargo onboard, the voyage details, and if a ransom was requested yet.

The vessel is owned by a Turkish shipping company, so the Turkish Navy and government were informed, along with other agencies and embassies.

The MV Cotton was built in 2007.
