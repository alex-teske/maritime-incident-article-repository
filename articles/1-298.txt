Agencies report that the "Brigades of Abdullah Azzam," described as "armed group linked to al-Qaeda" has claimed responsibility for last week's attack on the Mitsui OSK Lines oil tanker M Star near the Strait of Hormuz.

The Al Arabiya network reports the group as saying: "Last Wednesday, after midnight, the martyrdom-seeking hero Ayyub al-Taishan ... blew himself up in the Japanese tanker M Star in the Strait of Hormuz between the United Arab Emirates and Oman," the statement said.

An image from the group's website reproduced by Al Arabiya supposedly shows the bomber with a photograph of the M Star.

"We delayed the publication of the statement until our heroes returned safely to their bases," said the group's statement.
