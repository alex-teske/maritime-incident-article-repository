Classification society Korean Register (KR) has been granted authorization by the Portugal Maritime Authority (DGRM) to deliver statutory services on behalf of the Portugal flag state.

As informed, KR will act as a Recognized Organization (RO) conducting surveys and audits, issuing certificates to Portuguese flagged ships including those from Madeira, and ensuring full compliance with the SOLAS, MARPOL, ITC, ILL, and MLC regulations.

“Successfully obtaining authorization to act as an ‘RO’ for the Portuguese administration clearly demonstrates our continuous efforts to increase customer service levels … across Europe,” Lee Jeong-Kie, Chairman and CEO of KR, commented.

The latest authorization brings the total number of countries where KR is authorized to carry out ship survey and certification work to 78.

KR currently classes an international fleet of 3,042 vessels totaling 69 million GT.
