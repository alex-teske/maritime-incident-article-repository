A 31-year-old man in need of medical assistance was medevaced from an LNG carrier some 13 miles south of Oahu on January 13, 2017, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) informed.

Watchstanders at the Coast Guard Joint Rescue Coordination Center Honolulu received a request for a medevac from the master of the 173,400 cbm Barcelona Knutsen for the crewman who reportedly sustained injuries to his face while conducting maintenance on a fire extinguisher.

A helicopter aircrew from Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point hoisted the crewman aboard and safely delivered him in stable condition to awaiting emergency medical services personnel at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport.

The Spain-flagged vessel was approximately 575 miles south of the Big Island at the time of the request.

The LNG carrier is operated by Norway’s Knutsen OAS Shipping, VesselsValue’s data shows.
