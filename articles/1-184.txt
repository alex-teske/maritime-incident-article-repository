Three piracy attempts in last four days in the Gulf of Aden have been thwarted by the Indian Navy which neutralised eight armed Somali pirates, Navy officials said on Monday.

“Naval warship INS Sukanya thwarted the piracy attempts by Somali pirates in Gulf of Aden yesterday morning and September 20. In a swift operation, the Naval warship saved the two merchant vessels MV Fairchem Bronco and MV Conquerer yesterday,” the officials said here.

INS Sukanya, which is deployed in piracy infested Gulf of Aden to escort merchant vessels, noticed two high speed pirate boats approaching the merchant vessels in the wee hours on Sunday.

Responding to the situation, the naval ship asked the pirates to maintain a safe distance from the vessels through radio and sounded an alarm.

Soon a group of marine commandos on speed boats were launched to take stock of the situation and to ensure safety of the vessels.

“The action took place in darkness but the commandos successfully neutralized the pirates and seized the arms and ammunition including communication equipment. Pirates were also carrying ropes and ladder to board the merchant vessels,” the officials said.

The two merchant ships were later safely escorted out of the area.
