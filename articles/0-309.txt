Monaco-based container shipping company Navios Maritime Containers has acquired Navios Felicitas, a 2010-built containership. 

The 4,360 TEU boxship was delivered to Navios Containers’ fleet in December 2017.

As informed, the purchase price was USD 11.45 million. The Panamax ship, previously named Bonaire and APL Seoul, was bought from Germany-based NSC Schiffahrtsgesellschaft, VesselsValue’s data shows.

Navios Containers said it financed the acquisition of the vessel with cash on its balance sheet and USD 6 million of bank debt under one of its existing credit facilities.

Following this acquisition, Navios Containers controls 21 vessels, totaling 88,820 TEU.

Formed in June 2017, Navios Maritime Containers is the dedicated container vehicle in the Navios Group.
