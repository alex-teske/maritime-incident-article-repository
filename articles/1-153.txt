Latest attack shows the increasing reach of Somali pirates.

EU NAVFOR reports that the MV JAHAN MONI was pirated in the Somali Basin on Sunday, December 5. The Bangladesh-flagged bulk carrier was travelling about 1300 nautical miles east of Evl (Somalia) and more significantly, only 300 nautical miles from the Indian coast, a reminder that the reach of Somali pirates is increasing.

The ship, carrying 43,000 tons of nickel ore, has been spotted moving towards the Somali coast, leading officials to believe Somali pirates are responsible. If this is true, the pirates would have travelled more that 1,200 miles to launch the attack.

The ship has a crew of 26, all of whom are Bangladeshi. The ship’s management company Brave Royal, has reported that one of the sailors is travelling with his wife.

Sunday’s attack is the closest attack to India that Somali pirates have been known to attempt.

According to EU NAVFOR, pirates are currently holding 23 vessels (the MV JAHAN MONI included), with 547 hostages.
