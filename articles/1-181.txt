Six armed pirates boarded a tanker en route to Yangon, Myanmar on Monday, ICC Commercial Crime Services (CCS) said in its latest piracy report.
According to the report, the boarding took place some 34 nautical miles southwest of Phuket Island, Thailand.

The pirates tied up the second officer and able seaman on duty on the bridge and mustered the rest of the crew in the mess room.

ICC CCS said that the second officer managed to activate the SSAS alert without being noticed by the pirates who later escaped after stealing all crew personal effects and money.

Based on shipping data analysis, the attacked tanker is believed to be Ocean Osprey, owned by Ocean Tankers.

Namely, the location of the vessel and speed calculations indicate that Ocean Osprey could have been in the attack area at the specified time framework.
