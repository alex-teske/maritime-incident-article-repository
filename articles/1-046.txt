On 12 Feb 15, a Thailand-registered product tanker, Lapin departed Singapore for Krabi province, Thailand. The vessel with 15 crew was laden with 2,000 tons of bunker oil. On 13 Feb 15 at or about 1955 hrs (local time), six to eight perpetrators armed with pistols and knives boarded Lapin from a small boat at approximately 39.73 nm west-southwest of Port Klang, Malaysia (03° 11’ N, 100° 43’ E). The perpetrators gathered the crew and took control of the tanker. Thereafter, an unknown vessel came alongside Lapin and siphoned a total of five tons of diesel and 2,000 tons of bunker oil from Lapin. On 14 Feb 15 at or about 0400 hrs (local time), the perpetrators stopped the vessel and anchored Lapin at approximately 62.7 nm southwest of Port Klang (03° 23.94’ N, 100° 22.71’ E). After the perpetrators had siphoned the fuel/oil from Lapin, they destroyed the communication devices onboard Lapin and stole the ship property and the crew's belongings. The perpetrators also tied the crew, informed them that an improvised explosive package was left onboard and threatened the crew not to move, before they escaped.
