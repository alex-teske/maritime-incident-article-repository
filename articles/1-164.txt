Crew Taken Prisoner

Armed pirates kidnapped four mariners and robbed a vessel in south Nigeriaâ€™s Port Harcourt. The abducted crewmembers are believed to be Lithuanian and Ukrainian. There were 19 crewmembers on board the unnamed Comoros-flagged vessel prior to the incident.

The Lithuanian government has reported that the pirates boarded the vessel late Monday evening and stole cash, destroyed equipment and fled with the four crewmembers as hostages. The pirates have yet to make a ransom demand and the Lithuanians have set up a task force to respond to the incident. 

This is the first incident reported at sea off the Niger Delta in five months. In April, three crewmembers aboard the Surfer 1440 were kidnapped off the Nigerian coast.

Regional piracy reached all-time highs in 2008, and the Nigerian government has been active in combating it. Nigeria claims losses of about $9 million per year due to piracy and hundreds of millions are squandered in paid ransoms.

In September, Nigeria and the Republic of Togo agreed to conduct joint anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Guinea. Nigeria and Togo are both on the Gulf of Guinea. Togo President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe said the region loses more than $7 billion annually due to piracy.

Dryad Maritime, in its third quarter maritime crime statistics, revealed that West Africa had its lowest level of incidents during the quarter. The report notes that increased Nigerian naval activities also had an impact on regional piracy. The report said that regional countries need to coordinate efforts in the West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea.
