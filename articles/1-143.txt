Until recently, pirates have roamed around the open oceans looking for their next target, however they took a bold step in a rather new, and unsettling direction over the weekend.

While at anchor in the southern Omani port of Salalah, the Fairchem Bogey, a chemical tanker managed by Mumbai-based Angl0-Eastern Ship Management, was boarded by pirates and their crew taken hostage.

A report from the TImes of India stated this morning:

Eight pirates boarded the vessel around 6.30am and entered the engine control room. “The visibility at that time was poor. Though the Royal Oman Coast Guard tried to approach the vessel, the pirates threatened to kill the crew,” said the company official. Later, the Royal Oman Navy tried to intercept the vessel, but the pirates opened fire. Officials informed that the pirates later sailed the vessel in the direction of Somalia. “There have been no reported injuries or deaths,” said the official
