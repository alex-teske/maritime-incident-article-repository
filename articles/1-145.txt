The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) announced that two ships off Indonesia were attacked by pirates. The first incident took place close to Island of Mangkai in the South China Sea on April 13th. According to the IMB12 pirates armed with guns, swords and iron bars approached a bulk carrier underway in a speedboat. The master raised alarm and the crew directed fire hoses and Ship Security Alarm System was activated. The pirates still managed to board the ship and stole crew personal belongings, ship's cash, and property. After 50 minutes, they left the ship. No serious injuries to crew were reported.

The almost identical second incident involved a product tanker. Again, pirates stole the crews' personal belongings and ship's property and escaped. There were no injuries to crew.

In a brief report of an incident south of Mukalla port on Somalia's Gulf of Aden coast the IMB says pirates armed with guns attacked and hijacked a fishing vessel that had sailed into Somali territorial waters. The fishing vessel, along with its 34 crew was released when a military helicopter intervened.
