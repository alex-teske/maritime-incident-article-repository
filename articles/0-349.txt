Union Maritime’s Tanker with 22 Crew Goes Missing

by worldmaritimenews

UK based tanker owner and operator Union Maritime said that it has not heard from one of its vessels, MT Barrett, since late Tuesday, January 9.

The vessel was last reported to be at anchor off Benin, West Africa. Seafarers in the region are frequently being targeted by local pirate groups despite efforts of local navies led by the Nigerian Navy to curb attacks.

“On Wednesday we alerted local maritime authorities and are exploring all possible options and efforts as we continuously monitor the situation,” the company said.

“Whilst we are tirelessly working to locate the vessel, our primary concern is for the 22 crew on board and ensuring their safety.”

Union Maritime informed that it regularly operates from ports in this region and has a rigorous safety and security protocol.

“Crews are repeatedly drilled in all safety and emergency procedures,” Union Maritime added.

The MT Barrett (IMO: 9351749) is a 11,999-dwt tanker built in 2005 and registered in the Marshall Islands.
