Pirates seized a cargo ship on Monday with 24 crew members off the port of Aden, Yemen. The vessel, the MV Iceberg 1, was boarded just 10 miles from the port and was being taken toward the Somali coast, said the Ecoterra maritime monitoring agency in Kenya. Members of the crew of the ship, which flies the flag of Panama, are from Ghana, Pakistan, India, Sudan and Yemen, according to the East Africa Seafarers Assistance Program, which is also headquartered in Kenya. A spokesman for traders in Mogadishu, Somalia, said that seven other ships had been seized in the Indian Ocean over the weekend.
