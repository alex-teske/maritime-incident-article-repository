ABS grants AIP for newbuilding conversion FPSO hull design

JANUARY 9, 2018 by marinelog

Classification society ABS has granted Approval in Principle (AIP) to Hyundai Heavy Industries' (HHI) floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) hull design.

"The Newbuilding Conversion FPSO hull design can be built for about half the cost as compared to a conventional FPSO hull," says Jae-Eul Kim, HHI Senior Vice President, Shipbuilding Division. "In the current difficult energy market, the competitive Ready-to-Convert FPSO hull, with AIP from ABS, offers a practical approach to floating production unitsâ€”enabling stakeholders to take confident financial investment decisions."

"As the offshore industry strives to design more cost-effective production units, ABS remains committed to evaluating novel designs that meet our class standards," says ABS Executive Vice President, Global Offshore Ken Richardson. "Awarding HHI this AIP is another example of ABS's commitment to promoting safety in innovative concepts."

ABS and HHI worked together with the objective of developing a technically feasible and class compliant FPSO hull design, using the latest technologies while maintaining high safety standards. The ABS AIP demonstrates the design substantially complies with Class and Regulatory requirements, giving regulatory agencies and other key stakeholders confidence in the design.

The design basis is storing 2 Mbbl of crude oil in the barge-shaped hull, applying mainly shipbuilding standards, and combining offshore production facility features, such as a 25-year lifetime without drydocking, and structural reinforcement for topside structure installation.

In September last year, ABS granted HHI an AIP for a newbuilding conversion FLNG hull (see earlier story).
