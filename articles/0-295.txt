The RoPax ferry is specially designed for environmentally friendly operations in the Norwegian fjords with a fully electric battery package for continuous all-electric operations. The ferry, designed by Multi Maritime, will measure 74 meters in length with a beam of 14.20 meters, and will have a total capacity of up to 60 cars and 199 passengers and crew.

Mr. Roy Reite, CEO and Executive Director of VARD, said: “We are delighted to welcome Boreal as a new client to VARD, and look forward to building the battery-powered ferry, in which we can utilize our strong expertise in battery technology for efficient and environmentally friendly vessels.”

The hull of the vessel will be built by Vard Braila in Romania with delivery scheduled from Vard’s shipyard in Brevik, Norway in the third quarter of 2019.

The ferry will commence operations beginning in January 2020, crossing Kvanndal-Utne on the west coast of Norway where Boreal has been awarded a nine-year contract with the Norwegian government.
