A product tanker owned by Copenhagen-based Torm successfully fended off a group of pirates in the Gulf of Aden, the company said in a statement over the weekend.

Torm said that on Saturday a suspicious approach on the Torm Sofia by a group of pirates was deterred after the Filipino Master raised the alarm and an embarked armed security team took to their posts.

The LR1 product tanker Torm Sofia was underway in the Gulf of Aden from Sikka, India to New York when the attack occurred in position 13º15’4 North, 049º11’3 East, Torm said. The company added that the vessel was in full compliance with best management practices known as BMP 4.

“I am pleased that our capable crew acted according to our procedures and that everybody on board TORM Sofia is safe and unharmed,” says Tina Revsbech, Senior Vice President, Technical Division.

Torm added that it appreciates the continued naval presence in High Risk Areas in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia and reiterated statements from naval officials that the international maritime community must keep its focus on the continued piracy threat in the area.
