By recapp December 13, 2017

At or about 0515 hrs, a Marshall Islands registered oil tanker was underway off Pulau Karimun Kecil when four robbers dressed in short pants and t-shirts approached the tanker at the stern area on the starboard quarter side. Armed with knives, the robbers boarded the tanker from a fishing boat. Upon noticing the robbers, the crew sounded the alarm and proceeded to the protected area of the vessel. The robbers fled in their boat on hearing the alarm. Nothing was stolen from the tanker and the crew was not injured.
