On Thursday seven pirates attacked the Panama flagged bulk carrier, FULL CITY, in the Arabian Sea, taking the vessel and 24 Chinese crewmembers onboard, hostage. 

Officials say pirates attacked the vessel approximately 450 nautical miles off the coast of Mumbai and just 750 nautical miles east of an area where a Chinese Navy fleet was assembled.

Two of the Chinese navy vessels patrolling the Gulf of Aden have been sent to rescue the ship.

FULL CITY is owned by The Roc Maritime Inc. and is operated by COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co. 



FULL CITY made hadlines once before in 2009 when it ran aground after engine failure during a storm in Norway (pictured). The grounding sent 200 tons of heavy bunker fuel into the waters of a sensitive wildlife area.

Pirates are currently holding an estimated 24 vessels and 542 people hostage.
