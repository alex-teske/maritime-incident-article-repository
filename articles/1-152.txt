Pirates Hijack Luxury Yacht in Mediterranean

French police are on a manhunt this week for four armed pirates who hijacked a luxury yacht in waters off the coast of Corsica on Sunday.

The vessel was commandeered from its owners by a gang of masked and armed pirates as they sailed off the generally tranquil southwestern coast of Corsica, a popular yachting destination.

Fortunately, no one was hurt. However, the yacht’s owner, his wife and their captain were tied up by the pirates who snuck up on the yacht, named Armageddon, in a motor boat. After holding the trio hostage for three hours in a cabin, the pirates loaded then them into one of the yacht’s life boats and set them adrift in the Mediterranean Sea. They eventually washed ashore near the tiny village of Campomoro, which is north of where they were attacked, at around midnight.

Authorities said that type of attack was rare, but it will no doubt leave a few concerned about sailing in the popular area, especially private yachts and pleasure cruises.

The hijacked vessel can only travel a slow 8 knots. It is also highly noticeable because of its modern shape, brushed raw aluminum hull, and its red main sail.
