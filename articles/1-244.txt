Pirates hijack vessel off Oman coast

March 5, 2012 by marinelog

A maritime security alert has been issued for the Arabian Sea after a merchant vessel, MV Royal Grace, was reportedly hijacked in position 21:27N - 062:37E approximately 150NM off Oman on March 2, reports GAC Protective Solutions.

The hijack was only confirmed after the vessel communicated with the owners stating her position on 4 March. Her last known position was 17:12N - 060:28E at 0255 local time on 4 March.

Operators are advised to proceed with extreme caution in the vicinity of the attack as the attack group could still be in the area, and more generally when transiting within 180-200NM off Oman's southern coast which has seen an increase in pirate activity in recent weeks.

According to the Equasis data base, the 6,813 dwt, Panama-flagged, Royal Grace was built in 1984 as a Chemical/Oil Products Tanker and is managed by Oyster Cargo & Shipping LLC. The owner is Snow Whyte Energy Ltd., which uses the same Dubai address as the manager.

In the last 36 months, 50 percent of the vessel's Port State Control inspections have resulted in detentions.

(NSC 09/12) Masters are reminded that a large number of fishing vessels operate in the Southern Red Sea (SRS). Fishing vessels may approach a merchant ship in order to maximise fishing opportunities and to warn vessels from getting too close to the fishing nets. Masters are requested to ensure they distinguish between fishing vessels and potential pirates; fishermen may carry small arms.
