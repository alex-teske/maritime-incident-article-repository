Taiwan-listed container shipping major Evergreen Marine has revealed a very ambitious fleet renewal plan which will see 20 11,000 TEU containerships added to its fleet.

The company said that it has decided to invest up to USD 800 million to order the construction of eight 11,000 TEU containerships.

Five shipbuilders have been shortlisted as potential builders of the new ships, those being Taiwanese CSBC Corporation, Japanese Imabari Shipbuilding and Japan Marine United Corporation, along with their South Korean rivals Samsung Heavy Industries and Hyundai Heavy Industries.

Evergreen Marine said it will choose one of the builders to implement the order, but did not disclose the exact dates as it needs to negotiate the exact price of the new ships.

The company explains that it estimates to pay between USD 93-100 million per vessel.

The shipping company plans to use the new ships for future operation and fleet replacement.

Separately, Evergreen Marine said that it plans to charter 12 11,000 TEU containerships.

As disclosed, six chartered ships and four newbuildings from the batch will be ordered by the companyâ€™s Panamanian subsidiary Greencompass Marine SA (GMS), while the remaining ships from the series will be ordered by Evergreen Marine (Hong Kong).
