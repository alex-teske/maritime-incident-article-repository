Pirates Hijack UAE tanker with Filipino crew off Somalia: IMB

March 6, 2017 by Maritime-Executive

A dozen heavily armed pirates hijacked a UAE-registered tank vessel, along with its 19 Filipino crew members, off the coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). On Monday, the assailants, armed with machine guns, AK47 rifles, and side arms boarded the tanker off Mogadishu during daylight hours.

Previously, the oil tanker had discharged its cargo at Mogadishu port and was hit on March 29 after leaving port. Officials identified the ship as "Lin 1." The IMB also reported that the pirates are holding the ship off the coast of Somalia and have demanded a large sum of money from the owners for its release.

The international coalition forces, consisting of U.S, British, and Dutch warships that are helping to police the area, have been informed of the latest hijack. In the past three weeks, pirates have hit a total of 40 ships off Somalia, but the IMB maintains that many more attacks go unreported. IMB spokespersons urged ships and their crews to remain at least 125 miles off Somalia's coast line in an effort to discourage further attacks. The waters immediately off the Somalia coast are widely regarded to be the most dangerous in the world, with heavily armed gangs clearly willing and able to carry out attacks far offshore.
