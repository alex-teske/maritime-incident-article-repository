EU forces report that Somali pirates have captured a cargo ship about 450 nautical miles off of Yemen’s Socotra Island.



The cargo ship “MV THOR NEXUS” was transiting to Bangladesh from the United Arab Emirates with a crew of 27 Thai sailors.



Two days later on December 27, pirates attacked and successfully hijacked the MV EMS RIVER approximately 175 nautical miles north east of the port of Salalah, Oman. The Antigua/Barbuda flagged, German owned cargo ship was travelling from Jebel Ali, UAE to San Nicholas, Greece when she was attacked.



The ship has a crew of 8 and is carrying Petroleum Coke. The previously pirated MT MOTIVATOR was nearby during the attack, leading officials to believe the vessel is being used as a mother ship for pirates to launch attacks from.



Meanwhile, the Somali pirates released a German tanker captured on May 8, 2010. The tanker MARIDA MARGUERITE, which is owned by W-O Shipping Group, reportedly paid $5.5 million for its release. The ship had a crew of 22 including 19 Indian, one Ukrainian and two Bangladeshi mariners.



With the recent hijackings and release included, EU NAVFOR reports that there are now 25 vessels and 587 hostages being held by pirates off the coast of Somalia.
