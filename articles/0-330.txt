Lauritzen Kosan Reflags Two Gas Carriers to Denmark

by worldmaritimenews

Lauritzen Kosan, part of Danish shipping company J. Lauritzen, has reflagged two of its ships to Denmark for the first time since 2003.

The ships in question are the 8,053 cbm Helena Kosan and the 3,666 cbm Linda Kosan.

As informed, the registers of the two vessels have been changed to the Danish International Register of Shipping (DIS) as they begin a period time charter which will require an EU flag.

“The reflagging of these two gas carriers to Denmark is driven by commercial arguments, and it goes to show that the Danish flag is now very close to being as competitive as Malta, Singapore and the Isle of Man. There are still some challenges, but we very much appreciate the clear pro-business signals currently being sent by the Danish political system,” Mads P. Zacho, CEO of J. Lauritzen, commented.

“We very much appreciate the efforts made by the Maritime Strategy Team initiated by the Danish government, which gave its recommendations in April 2017. The subsequent proposals put forward by a broad coalition in parliament with new and significant measures to increase the competitiveness of the Danish flag have clearly had an impact, shown by the reflagging of our two gas carriers to DIS,” Zacho added.

Currently, Lauritzen Kosan’s fleet is comprised of 31 gas carriers.
