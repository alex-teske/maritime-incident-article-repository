Recently, an oil tanker encountered 11 suspicious skiffs about 4 miles North of their position - (12 20N) Long: (044 03E) (aboutt 40 miles ESE of Babel Mandeb TSS).

The vessel immediately raised the alarm and the entire crew, except the bridge team retrated in the citadel. The fire pump was started. The security team, United Marine Security, was already on the bridge wing. The ship's crew also informed a naval aircraft on VHF 16, which was patrolling in the area.

One skiff increased speed and began to approach the tanker from the starboard bow and came close to the distance of about 1 mile from the vessel, then stopped. 7-8 pirates were visible in the skiff.

In the mean time, a naval aircraft approached the location close to the skiff. Sighting this, the Skiff aborted any further approach and moved away towards the coast.
