Nigeria: Pirates Kidnap 3 Sailors Off Coast

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FEB. 8, 2013

Pirates off the coast of Nigeria and Cameroon attacked a ship and kidnapped three sailors, including two Russians, in the latest assault on shippers in the increasingly dangerous waters of the Gulf of Guinea, officials said Friday. A statement from the company that owns the ship, Carisbrooke Shipping, said pirates boarded the ship late Thursday night and stole the sailorsâ€™ personal belongings before leaving with the three sailors. Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea has escalated from low-level armed robberies to hijackings and cargo thefts. The attacks also have begun to stretch beyond the waters immediately near Nigeria. On Sunday, a gang of pirates seized control of a French-owned oil tanker off Ivory Coast, kidnapping the 17 sailors on board. The pirates released the ship and its sailors a few days later after most likely stealing the diesel fuel the ship had on board.
